# Rock Paper Scissors Game
### This is my ongoing project.
I create this game not only as mandatory project to pass software engineer course but also as a passionate fun project for the whole family to get involved. I use HTML5, CSS3, and javaScript to create simple Rack Paper Scissors game application.
